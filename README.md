# ThunderPackerGUI

This program packages mods for Thunderstore.io. The process to create a mod is rather simple:
 - Use the select file buttons to select and find your ModNameHere.dll file and your icon.png file.
 - Fill out some fields for the manifest (name, version, and desc are required)
 - For dependencies, no need to add quotes or commas. Just leave raw text.
 - Use the README Editor to either create a readme, or under 'Additions', check 'Exclude Readme' to skip this step
 - Click pack, and wait a few.

# Known issues
 - When you pack and the explorer opens, its just to your documents folder.

# Upcoming features
 - Autofill, let's automatically fill in some properties.
 - Optimization, let's try to reduce that file size.
 - More (still being decided upon) features.
